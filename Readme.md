# Ogmo Editor

This is a fork of the original, first Ogmo Editor by [Matt Thorson](http://www.mattmakesgames.com/). Find more information about the original one on http://www.ogmoeditor.com

# Building

Sadly due to time constraints I have not prepared any easy to use build methods.

The way I do it is to open the project in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), configure flex and just run it. Hopefully it's enough to get you started, but if you have any issues contact me directly.

# Differences from the original Ogmo Editor

Going by memory here, so I surely am missing some things:
 
 - Select value type where you toggle between different predefined states
 - Pencil to draw on a random tile
 - Rectangle drawing draws the tiles normally
 - Some speed optimizations
